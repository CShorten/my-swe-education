To remove all rows from a table in SQL, you have two primary options:

# Option 1: DELETE FROM
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```

This command removes all rows from the table.
It can be rolled back in most transactional database systems.
It may be slower for very large tables because it deletes each row individually.

# Option 2: TRUNCATE TABLE
```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name
```
This command also removes all rows from the table but is typically much faster than DELETE for large tables.

1. It often resets identity counters (e.g., auto-increment columns).
2. It cannot be rolled back in many database systems (non-transactional).
3. It usually requires special permissions (often higher than those needed for DELETE).

Choose the method that best fits your needs, depending on whether you need transaction support or a faster, more permanent cleanup.
