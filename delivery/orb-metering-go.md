# Orb Billing Metering Implementation Guide

## Overview
Orb is a modern usage-based billing system that enables businesses to implement complex metering and pricing models. This guide covers the key components and implementation steps for integrating Orb into your application's billing infrastructure.

## Core Concepts

### Event Ingestion
Orb's metering system starts with event ingestion. Events represent billable actions in your system and can be sent to Orb through:

1. Direct API calls using the ingest endpoint
2. Real-time event streaming via Kafka
3. Batch uploads for historical data

Events should include:
- Timestamp
- Customer identifier
- Event name/type
- Relevant quantities
- Custom properties for filtering

### Meter Configuration

Meters in Orb define how raw events are transformed into billable usage. Key aspects include:

- Aggregation functions (sum, max, unique count, etc.)
- Time windows (hour, day, month)
- Filtering conditions
- Custom transformations
- Deduplication rules

### Price Plans

Price plans connect meters to pricing models through:

- Usage tiers with different rates
- Volume pricing
- Package pricing
- Minimum commitments
- Custom pricing functions

### Real-time Usage Tracking

Orb provides real-time usage monitoring through:

- Usage dashboards
- Alerts and notifications
- Usage forecasting
- Rate limiting integration
- Quota management

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Create an Orb account and obtain API credentials
2. Install the Orb SDK for your programming language
3. Configure webhook endpoints for notifications
4. Set up authentication for API access

### 2. Event Implementation

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "time"

    "github.com/orbcorp/orb-go"
    "github.com/orbcorp/orb-go/event"
)

func main() {
    client := orb.NewClient("your_api_key")

    eventParams := &event.IngestParams{
        CustomerID: "cust_123",
        EventName:  "api_request",
        Timestamp:  time.Now(),
        Properties: map[string]interface{}{
            "endpoint":      "/api/v1/data",
            "response_time": 150,
            "status_code":   200,
        },
    }

    ctx := context.Background()
    result, err := client.Events.Ingest(ctx, eventParams)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error ingesting event: %v", err)
    }

    log.Printf("Successfully ingested event: %v", result)
}
```

### 3. Meter Configuration

1. Define event schemas
2. Create meters for each billable metric
3. Set up aggregation rules
4. Configure filtering conditions
5. Implement transformations

### 4. Price Plan Setup

1. Create pricing tiers
2. Define billing periods
3. Set up minimum commitments
4. Configure discounts
5. Implement custom pricing rules

### 5. Integration Testing

1. Test event ingestion
2. Verify meter calculations
3. Validate price calculations
4. Test usage alerts
5. Verify invoice generation

## Best Practices

### Event Design
- Keep events atomic and granular
- Include all relevant metadata
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include customer context
- Maintain event versioning

### Performance Optimization
- Batch events when possible
- Implement retry logic
- Use appropriate time precision
- Monitor API rate limits
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling
- Log failed events
- Set up monitoring alerts
- Use fallback mechanisms
- Maintain an event buffer

### Security Considerations
- Secure API credentials
- Implement request signing
- Use HTTPS for all requests
- Validate webhook signatures
- Monitor for unusual patterns

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Data Consistency
- Implement idempotency keys
- Use consistent timestamps
- Handle timezone conversions
- Maintain event ordering
- Implement data validation

### Scale Considerations
- Plan for data volume growth
- Implement efficient querying
- Use appropriate indexing
- Consider data retention policies
- Monitor system performance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Event ingestion rate
- Processing latency
- Error rates
- API response times
- System resource usage

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Audit event schemas
- Review pricing rules
- Update meters as needed
- Monitor system health
- Backup configuration

## Conclusion

Implementing Orb for billing metering requires careful planning and attention to detail. Success depends on proper event design, robust implementation, and ongoing monitoring. Regular reviews and updates ensure the system continues to meet business needs while maintaining performance and reliability.
