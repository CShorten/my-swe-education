Think of Ingress as a layer that sits in front of your Services to manage external HTTP/HTTPS traffic coming into your cluster. While a Service handles internal traffic routing between Pods, Ingress manages how external traffic enters your cluster and reaches those Services.
Here's a concrete example:
Let's say you have three microservices running in your cluster:

A frontend web app at myapp.com
An API at myapp.com/api
A documentation site at docs.myapp.com

Without Ingress, you'd need separate LoadBalancer Services for each one, which can be expensive and harder to manage. With Ingress, you can define rules to route traffic based on paths and hostnames, like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myapp-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: frontend-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: docs.myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: docs-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

Key points about Ingress:

It requires an Ingress Controller (like NGINX, Traefik, or others) to actually implement the rules
It can handle SSL/TLS termination for your services
It supports advanced features like URL rewriting, rate limiting, and authentication depending on the controller you use
