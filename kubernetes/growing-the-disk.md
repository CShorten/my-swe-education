"Growing the disk" in a Kubernetes context typically refers to increasing the storage capacity of a Persistent Volume (PV) that's being used by your application, Grafana, or Prometheus. Let me explain this in more detail:

When running Grafana and Prometheus on Kubernetes, they typically use Persistent Volumes to store their data:
- Grafana stores dashboards, users, and configurations
- Prometheus stores its time-series metrics data, which can grow significantly over time

Growing the disk involves several steps:

1. Storage Class Capability Check
- Verify if your storage class supports volume expansion
- The storage class must have `allowVolumeExpansion: true`

2. PVC Modification
- Edit the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to request more storage
- For example, changing from 10Gi to 20Gi:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: prometheus-data
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 20Gi  # Increased from 10Gi
```

3. Volume Expansion
- Kubernetes will automatically trigger the volume expansion
- The underlying storage provider handles the actual disk expansion
- Some providers might require pod restart, others can do it online

Common scenarios where you'd need to grow the disk:
- Prometheus retention period needs to be increased
- More metrics are being collected
- Grafana is storing more dashboards or alerts
- Application logs or metrics are consuming more space than initially planned

If you'd like, I can provide more specific details about growing disks for either Grafana or Prometheus, or explain how to monitor disk usage to proactively plan for growth.
