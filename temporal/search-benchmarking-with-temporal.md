# Temporal Orchestration for Search System Benchmarking

## Executive Summary

This report outlines a fault-tolerant approach to orchestrating a large-scale benchmark of 3,000 search queries using Temporal, where each query takes approximately 7 seconds to execute. The proposed solution provides automatic retry mechanisms, progress tracking, and resilient execution across potential system failures.

## Problem Statement

**Scope**: Execute 3,000 benchmark queries against a search system  
**Duration per Query**: ~7 seconds  
**Total Estimated Time**: ~5.8 hours (sequential) or significantly less with parallelization  
**Requirements**: Fault tolerance, progress monitoring, and reliable completion

## Why Temporal for Benchmark Orchestration

Temporal excels at long-running, fault-tolerant workflows making it ideal for benchmark orchestration because it provides:

**Durability**: Workflow state persists across worker restarts and system failures  
**Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff  
**Visibility**: Real-time progress monitoring and execution history  
**Scalability**: Horizontal scaling across multiple workers  
**Fault Isolation**: Individual query failures don't compromise the entire benchmark

## Architecture Design

### Workflow Structure

```
BenchmarkWorkflow
├── InitializeBenchmark (Activity)
├── ParallelQueryExecution
│   ├── QueryBatch1 (Child Workflow)
│   ├── QueryBatch2 (Child Workflow)
│   └── QueryBatchN (Child Workflow)
└── GenerateReport (Activity)
```

### Key Components

**Main Workflow**: `BenchmarkOrchestrationWorkflow`
- Coordinates the entire benchmark execution
- Manages batch distribution and parallel execution
- Aggregates results and handles completion

**Child Workflows**: `QueryBatchWorkflow`
- Executes batches of 50-100 queries each
- Provides granular fault tolerance
- Enables efficient retry of smaller units

**Activities**: 
- `ExecuteSearchQuery`: Performs individual search operations
- `ValidateResults`: Ensures query responses meet expected criteria  
- `RecordMetrics`: Captures performance data and statistics

## Implementation Strategy

### Batch Processing Approach

Rather than executing 3,000 individual workflows, queries are grouped into manageable batches of 50-100 queries each. This approach:

- Reduces Temporal server overhead
- Provides better failure granularity than single large workflow
- Enables efficient parallel processing
- Simplifies progress tracking and reporting

### Parallelization Strategy

**Recommended Concurrency**: 10-20 parallel batches initially
- Monitor system resources and search service performance
- Scale up or down based on observed bottlenecks
- Consider search service rate limits and capacity

**Dynamic Scaling**: Adjust concurrency during execution based on:
- Search service response times
- Error rates and timeout frequency
- Available system resources

### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

**Retry Policies**:
```
Query Level: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
Batch Level: 2 attempts with 30-second intervals
Workflow Level: Infinite retries with manual intervention points
```

**Timeout Handling**:
- Query timeout: 15 seconds (more than 2x expected duration)
- Batch timeout: 30 minutes
- Overall workflow timeout: 8 hours

**Failure Isolation**: Failed queries are logged but don't block batch completion. Critical failures trigger alerts while maintaining benchmark progress.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Real-Time Metrics

**Progress Tracking**:
- Completed queries count and percentage
- Average query execution time
- Current batch status and estimated completion

**Performance Metrics**:
- Queries per second throughput
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate and failure categorization

**System Health**:
- Worker capacity utilization
- Search service response patterns
- Resource consumption trends

### Alerting Strategy

**Critical Alerts**: Overall failure rate >5%, complete workflow stall >30 minutes  
**Warning Alerts**: Individual batch failures, response time degradation >50%  
**Info Notifications**: Milestone completions (every 500 queries), estimated completion time updates

## Data Management

### Input Management
- Query definitions stored in distributed storage (S3/GCS)
- Configurable query parameters and expected result validation
- Support for different query types and complexity levels

### Results Storage
- Individual query results with timing and validation status
- Batch-level summaries with statistical aggregations  
- Raw performance data for detailed post-analysis
- Structured export formats (JSON, CSV) for further processing

### State Persistence
Temporal automatically persists workflow execution state, ensuring no data loss during system interruptions and enabling seamless resume capability.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Query-Level Failures
- Immediate retry with exponential backoff
- Detailed error logging and categorization
- Graceful degradation without blocking batch progress

### Batch-Level Failures  
- Automatic batch retry with fresh worker assignment
- Partial result preservation and incremental progress
- Manual intervention capabilities for persistent issues

### System-Level Failures
- Automatic workflow resume after infrastructure recovery
- Cross-region failover support for critical benchmarks
- Complete audit trail of execution and recovery events

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Utilization
- Worker pool sizing based on available CPU and memory
- Connection pooling for search service interactions
- Efficient batch size tuning based on observed performance

### Bottleneck Management
- Search service rate limiting and capacity planning
- Network bandwidth considerations for large result sets
- Storage I/O optimization for high-frequency metric recording

## Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1** (Week 1): Core workflow and activity implementation  
**Phase 2** (Week 2): Monitoring, alerting, and observability integration  
**Phase 3** (Week 3): Performance tuning and optimization  
**Phase 4** (Week 4): Production deployment and validation testing

## Conclusion

Temporal provides an excellent foundation for orchestrating large-scale, fault-tolerant benchmark operations. The proposed architecture balances execution efficiency with operational resilience, ensuring reliable completion of the 3,000-query benchmark while providing comprehensive visibility into performance and progress.

The batch-based approach with intelligent parallelization should complete the benchmark in approximately 1-2 hours while maintaining full fault tolerance and detailed performance insights. This solution scales effectively for even larger benchmark suites and provides a reusable framework for ongoing search system performance validation.
